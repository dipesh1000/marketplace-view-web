                We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect
                is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the
                opportunity to update your information through your account
                profile settings. In the event that you believe your information
                is in any way incorrect or inaccurate, please let us know
                immediately. We will make sure we investigate the matter and
                correct any inaccuracies as quickly as possible where necessary
                or give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless
                we have to keep that information for legitimate business or
                legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we will
                ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your
                request. If for any reason you have a problem with deleting your
                personal information, please contact Fiverr's Customer Support
                and we will make reasonable efforts to delete any such
                information pursuant to any applicable privacy laws.
