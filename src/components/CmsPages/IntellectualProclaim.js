            Fiverr.com's content is based on User Generated Content (UGC).
            Fiverr does not check user uploaded/created content for violations
            of copyright or other rights. However, if you believe any of the
            uploaded content violates your copyright or a related exclusive
            right, you should follow the process below. Fiverr looks into
            reported violations and removes or disables content shown to be
            violating third party rights.
